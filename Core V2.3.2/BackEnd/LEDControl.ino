LED Control

This task is responsible for running lighting animations on the front of the device.
Animation patterns are pre-defined, and swapped between as system states change. 
Many situations have a static LED color. 
The task independently monitors the system state, and sets the animations accordingly.

Animation 0: Flashing Red
* Overtemperature condition
* Unable to reach NFC reader after multiple attempts

Animation 1: Solid Red
* Lockout State
* Access Denied, until card removed

Animation 2: Solid Green
* Unlocked State
* AlwaysOn State

Animation 3: Solid Yellow
* Idle State

Animation 4: Flashing Yellow
* Card inserted, but not verified yet.

Animation 5: Cycle green/white
* Unlocked or AlwaysOn and no network

Animation 6: Solid white
* Idle and no network

Global Variables Used:
Red: LED Red Channel
Blue: LED Blue Channel
Green: LED Green Channel
NewLED: Indicates a new set of LED colors is ready to send
